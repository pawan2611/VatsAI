 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.
 Machine Learning (ML) is a type of AI that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so.
 Deep Learning (DL) is a type of ML that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn from data.
 Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that gives computers the ability to understand and generate human language.
 Computer Vision (CV) is a field of AI that gives computers the ability to "see" and understand images and videos.
 Robotics is the field of engineering that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots.
 Blockchain is a distributed database that is used to maintain a continuously growing list of records, called blocks.
 Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security.
 Quantum Computing (QC) is a type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data.
 Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects to connect and exchange data.
